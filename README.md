# Space Dino

A physics-based space grappling game featuring a cyber-dinosaur navigating through increasingly dangerous cosmic environments.

## Game Overview

Control a purple cyber-dino as it swings through space using a grappling hook mechanic. Avoid asteroids, comets, shooting stars, and black holes while traveling as far as possible through four distinct zones.

## How to Play
